Understanding the urban heat island is important for policy and health. Urban simulations are often evaluated using a few observation stations. While many papers are motivated by policy concerns, their evaluation metrics do not reflect this. We first identify several critical characteristics of Baltimore's UHI using a novel dataset collected by over 100 low-cost thermometer/hygrometers. We evaluate the model using these characteristics and show that WRF fails to capture several UHI properties that are important.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Heat exposure is one of the deadliest forms of climate hazards \cite{wmo}, killing an average of 130 people annually in the United States \citep{usnh_stat}. In resource-poor settings, the health burden is even higher \citep{wmo}. Rising global temperatures raise the public health and economic consequences of heat exposure \citep{ipcc}. Urban alterations to the natural landscape raise temperatures, a phenomena known as the urban heat island or UHI that is one of the most significant ways in which humans alter the atmosphere \citep{kalnay2003impact}. This creates the possibility that cities may be more affected by the consequences of heat exposure than outlying rural areas. 
City governments are thus interested in incorporating urban heat island mitigation into long term planning \citep{shickman2016current}, primarily to mitigate the impacts of heatwaves \citep{hewitt2014cool}. Much of the UHI literature focuses on attributing and understanding the causes of urban heating, while UHI mitigation is less studied \citep{huang2018urban}; accordingly, cities cite a lack of local data and knowledge as hindering their progress \citep{hewitt2014cool}. %Thus, understanding policy priorities is key to aiding urban heat mitigation efforts. 
 
While dense sensor networks provide the data necessary to support UHI understanding in some cities (for example, \cite{scott2017intraurban,scott2017temperature,madisonUHI,minneapolisUHI,tokyoUHI}), numerical models can play a key role in filling local knowledge gaps. Urban simulations using the WRF modeling system \citep{chen2011integrated} have been evaluated using data from cities worldwide in climate zones ranging from desert to sub-tropical, from Phoenix \citep{georgescu2013summer} to Beijing \citep{wang2013modeling} to Sydney \citep{argueso2014temperature} to Rotterdam \citep{theeuwes2014seasonal}. All of the 50 most cited studies using WRF/urban modelling system conclude that it performs well for modeling the urban environment, with mean RMSEs for 2-meter temperature being reported as ranging from $0.6-4.0^\circ C$ (see a summary of performance in \cite{kim2013evaluation}).
Authors evaluate the accuracy of WRF in different ways. This includes using observations of temperature (eg, \citet{kusaka2012numerical}), wind, humidity and precipitation (eg, \cite{miao2011impacts,chen2011numerical}), pollutant concentrations \citep{brioude2013top}, and energy fluxes at the surface \citep{yang2015enhancing,loridan2012multi}, in the near-surface atmosphere as well as aloft using atmospheric profilers and flight campaigns \citep{li2013development}. In the case of surface observations, studies compared data from the model pixel located nearest to the observation station rather than interpolating and quantified model agreement with observations using statistical metrics such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation, bias, hit rate, index of agreement, or coefficient of determination \citep{loridan2010trade,salamanca2011study,lee2011evaluation,chen2011numerical,chen2014wrf,li2013multi}.

%Cities examined included Asian agglomerations of Shanghai, Singapore, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, North American cities of Phoenix, Houston, Los Angeles, and Baltimore-Washington, and European cities of Paris, London, and Rotterdam. The only Southern Hemisphere city examined was Sydney, Australia \cite{argueso2014temperature}. One study examined an fictional, idealized city in continental Europe \citep{theeuwes2014seasonal}, and several studies examined multiple sites. No cities in Africa, South America, or Central or Southern Asia were included in this sample.  Several areas have been examined multiple times, such as Baltimore-Washington or Shanghai. Several of these studies focus on evaluation of WRF by varying parameterizations or boundary layer physics options. Most studies use WRF as a tool to understand physical processes that drive urban temperature or weather events. Others use WRF to explore UHI mitigation measures. A common question was quantifying the role of urbanization in temperature trends.

While some studies use an extensive network to evaluate surface charactistics-for example, \cite{miao2011impacts} used a network of 60 stations in China---very few studies evaluate the model at the resolution at which it is run, potentially affecting conclusions of model accuracy. Additionally, while all of these studies examined temperature in urban areas, only 13 out of 50 explicitly examined urban-rural differences. Of these, even fewer used urban-rural differences as an evaluation metric. For example, \citet{li2013synergistic} examined how Baltimore's urban heat island evolved during a heatwave using numerical simulations, and evaluated the model by comparing a time-series of 2-meter modelled temperature to two observation stations; the authors reported the mean bias and RMSE. Though their analysis shows that the model exaggerates the sign of the diurnal cycle, the authors conclude that in examining urban-rural differences, the biases will cancel and thus the model is adequate for examining urban-rural thermal contrasts.  Other UHI characteristics, such as the spatial variability of temperature, or the relationship between green infrastructure and temperature, were not used to evaluate simulations. 

This approach leaves open several questions about the urban heat island. It has been reported that the UHI varies as a function of .. (insert part from other paper here). However, it X still unclear. For example, (that Nature paper) did Y.  

Baltimore, Md. (pop. X) is a mid-size city on the East Coast of the United States \ref{fig:map}  with a small, central downtown core of buildings greater than three stories, neighborhoods dominated by two-three story brick rowhomes, and outlying higher-elevation neighborhoods and suburbs with grass lawns, multi-level detached homes, and trees. Tree canopy covered 28 percent of Baltimore in 2015.

 Several studies have examined Baltimore's UHI previously using observations \citep{Huang20111753,scott2017intraurban,brazel2000tale} or models \citep{zhang2011impact,li2013development,li2013synergistic,li2015contrasting}. However, these modeling studies were limited in their evaluation of the model by using only a few observational stations. Additionally, they did not evaluate the model against a criteria of accurately simulating the diurnal cycle, spatial variability, or other characteristics. 

In this paper, we use a novel dataset to analyze temperature variability in Baltimore and characterize several important characteristics of the urban heat island. Through analyzing this dataset, we quantify answers to the following questions: 
1) How variable is urban temperature? 
2) How does urban heat island intensity vary throughout the day? and
3) How does land type and green infrastructure affect urban heat island intensity? 
These answers describe key UHI characteristics identified by observations which we use to develop evaluation criteria for numerical simulations. 
This approach builds on previous urban heat island studies by offering an observational network of unprecedented scale and using that information to create better model evaluation criteria.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Observations}
Temperature observations in this paper come from a network of iButton thermometer/hygrometers located throughout the Greater Baltimore area (Fig.~\ref{fig:map}b). 
iButtons were installed in 91 sites beginning in May 2016, with the full network installed by July 1, 2016; at the end of the summer, 85 sensors remained. Thus, in this study we examine data taken between July 1, 2016 and August 30, 2016. Nearly all sites (79) were located within Baltimore City; the remaining 6 were north of the city in Baltimore County. During installation, local site data was taken on the surrounding site characteristics: 24 sensors were located in locations dominated by impervious surfaces, 43 were located in locations with grass and low vegetation, 13 sensors with bare or little ground-cover, and 5 sites with a mix of these characteristics. 

Thermometers were housed in a custom shield in a custom, naturally aspirated radiation shield made of WhiteOptics White98 Reflector Film and attached to trees and poles as in Fig.~\ref{fig:ibutton}a using a plastic zip-tie. Out of the 85 sensors, 61 sensors were attached to trees, 17 sensors were attached to metal poles, and 7 were attached to wooden posts. Most of these were estimated to be located in partial shade (38) or full shade (24); the remainder were located in full sun (23). 

 To describe the land use type (hereafter, land type) of each observation site, we use the 40-class Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land type included in WRF to categorize sites. Our sites are located in developed high intensity, developed medium and developed low intensity, developed open space, and non-developped deciduous forest land.
 Table \ref{tab:lcc} shows each land type examined in this study and the corresponding MODIS classifications, which are the same with the exception that we combine the developed, medium intensity classification (MODIS 25) with the developed, low intensity classification (MODIS 24) to make a combined medium and low intensity category. We also add an urban forest classification, not described by MODIS but available from our own \textit{in situ} site description. 
 % also add something about street trees? 
For developed land types, this study includes 20-30 sites for each category; only 3 sites are included in the rural/forest area. 

These site classifications correspond to a range of possible vegetative fractions. In order to calculate vegetation fractions quantitatively, we calculate satellite observations of Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI), the normalized difference of near-infrared light $NIR$ to visible red light $VIS$: 
\[NDVI = \frac{NIR-VIS}{NIR+VIS}\]
at each observation site. The data is downloaded from Landsat-8 using the Google Earth Engine platform. We selected the least cloudy scene during the period June 1, 2016- August 15, 2016. 

iButtons have been evaluated in the literature () and have been reported to agree well particularly for nighttime temperatures, but exhibit a warm bias (). Thus, we co-locate one of the iButtons with an Automated Surface Observation System (http://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/) station in downtown Baltimore (station DMH). This station provides sub-hourly measurements with reported accuracies of $< 0.5^\circ $C. In Fig.\ref{fig:bias}, we compare the ASOS measurements with the iButton measurement. We find that the measurements agree well--the mean difference (iButtons-ASOS) is $0.44^\circ$C the distributions of summertime temperatures for all hours (Fig.~\ref{fig:bias}a) is similar, and the correlation for the two instruments is $r = 0.96$. 

However, hourly measurements agree less well: the 6am error is $-0.29^\circ$C, and the 4pm error is $1.18^\circ$C. The average summertime hourly temperature, Fig.~\ref{fig:bias}c), shows that in addition to a overestimate of afternoon temperature, the diurnal temperature cycle differs between the instruments. Whereas the iButton indicates that $T_{min}$ occurs at 6am, the ASOS instrument indicates 5am. This is also born out in the fact that the mean error for $T_{min}$ is lower than for 6am data, though the same is not true for $T_{max}$ and 4pm data. In order to compensate for this instrument bias, we subtract the hourly difference between the iButton and the ASOS station as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bias}c) from each iButton instrument on each day

\subsection{Numerical Model}
This paper uses the Weather, Research, and Forecasting Model (WRF) vx.x. Get Hamada to help fill in here. 

In this paper, we refer to the following variables from the model: 2-meter temperature (T2),
 land-use type (LU INDEX), vegetative fraction (VF),
 latent heat (LH), 
 sensible heat (HFX), ground flux (GRDFLX), 
incoming shortwave radiation (SWDNB),
reflected outgoing shortwave radiation (SWUPB), 
reflected incoming longwave radiation (LWDNB) and outgoing longwave radiation (LWUPB).  
We compute the net energy flux $F$ as

\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:seb}
F= r_{net} -LH - HFX - GRDFLX
\end{equation}
where the instantaneous radiative forcing $$r_{net}=LWDNB + SWNDB-SWUPB$$. 
  
\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluate the simulated 2-meter temperature against the observation in the nearest grid box using several statistical methods. First, the root-mean squared error $RMSE$, comparing observations $O_i$ to simulation data $S_i$:  
\begin{equation}%\label{eq:rmse}
RMSE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(S_i - O_i\right)^2
\end{equation}
. The $RMSE$ in this case has units of $^\circ$C$^2$. Next, we examine the Pearson correlation $r$ and its corresponding p-value $p$, indicating the probability that the given correlation is due to chance. The coefficient of determination, $r^2$. We also examine the Modified Index of Agreement or $MIOA$ (Willmott 1981), varying between \(0\) and \(1\), with \(1\) indicating a perfect match and zero indicating no match: 
\begin{equation}
md = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(O_{i}-S_{i})^{j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}|(S_{i}-\bar{O})|+|(O_{i}-\bar{O})|^{j}}
%\label{eq:modified_index_of_agreement}
\end{equation}
where $j=1$. 
Then, we calculate the percent bias (PBIAS), where a value of zero is a perfect match; positive values indicate that the model overestimates the model while negative values indicate that the sensor is underestimates the reading.
\begin{equation}
PBIAS = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(O_{i}-S_{i})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}O_{i}}*100
%\label{eq:pbias}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Statistics}
To separate temporal error from error induced by spatial variability, we we calculate each of the above metrics for spatially average temperature and temporally averaged temperature. We refer to temporally averaged temperature as $\overline{T}$ and spatially averaged temperature as $\langle T \rangle$. 

To quantify spatial variability within the urban heat island, we calculate the semi-variance. The semi-variance provides a measure of spatial variance as a function of distance; it indicates an average difference between two data points $f(a), f(a+h)$ given their distance apart $h$: 
$$ s(h) = \frac{1}{2 N(h)} \sum _{N(h)} \left(f(a+h) -f(a)\right)^2 $$
Here, we calculate the experimental semi-variance by making $h$ a discrete variable equal to fixed-width distances of 1 km for modelled data and .1 km for observed data. 


\section{Results}\label{sec:results} 
\subsection{Observations}
\subsubsection{Histogram}
Temperature in summer 2016 ranged from X-X degrees, with an average temperature of X. In comparison with past years, this summer was warmer/cooler/average (as measured by X metric). 
Temperature varies across the city, with a range in time-averaged temperature of X and an overall standard deviations is X. Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}a) shows histograms of mean temperature for all hours at each site grouped by land types. For each land type, temperatures are normally distributed. 
High intensity land use is hottest, with a mean temperature of X. Medium and low intensity land is cooler, and rural forests are coolest. 
The standard deviation of temperature is less than 1$^\circ$C in all cases, with open space having the highest standard deviation ($\sigma = 0.89^\circ$ C). We repeat this analysis for mean 6am temperatures in Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}b) and see that similarly, higher intensity land types are hotter than lower intensity land types, with high intensity land the hottest, and rural forest the least hot. Temperatures at 4pm (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}c) are more variable than those at 6am, with medium and low intensity land types having the highest variability ($\sigma = 1.92$). 
% Note: add urban forest or urban green category here? 
% concluding statement here
\subsubsection{Semi-variograms}
Next, we examine how different locations vary from one another by looking at the spatial auto-correlation, indicating the similar are two nearby points. Figure~\ref{fig:semiv_obs} shows a semi-variogram: the semi-variance (in units of variance or $^\circ$C$^2$) is plotted against distance for all locations at 6am. For sites within one kilometer of one another, the semi-variance is less than X, which translates to temperature differences of X/X on average. As distance between sites increases, the semi-variance increases linearly, indicating that farther away points are more and more dissimilar. While the semi-variance is noisier at longer distances, this is due to having fewer datapoints at certain distances. This may be why the semi-variogram exceeds its theoretical limit of the sample variance for some of the distances between 15-25 kilometers. Overall, we see that sites closer together are more auto-correlated, that is, similar to closer sites, and farther sites are less auto-correlated and more dissimilar. If temperature of one sight was independent of another site, then this would exacerbate efforts to implement urban heat island reduction policies. Our result suggests that rather than air temperatures being entirely random, changes in one location may affect nearby locations. 

%Having addressed spatial variability, we now turn to its cause. Previous studies have suggested that variability in the land type drives temperature variability (eg, Scott et al 2016). In Figure Xb, we look at sites dominated by impervious landcover at 6am and see that the variogram follows a similar pattern to that of Fig.~Xa: closer sites are similar and farther sites are dissimilar. At distances beyond 15km, the semi-variances remain close to the variance of X. This is in contrast with the semi-variogram for green landcovers at 6am (Fig.Xc). Though overall green sites have lower variance, the semi-variance increases with distance without evidence of a limit. In the afternoon, variability is higher for variograms of all sites, impervious sites, and green sites at 6pm (Fig.Xd,e,f). The variance for all data, (3.9 Fig.Xd), translates into an average temperature difference of 1.98$^\circ$C degrees, much higher than that at 6am. Impervious spaces remain dissimilar for the range of distances examined (Fig.~Xe). Green spaces grow dissimilar at a constant rate, but remain less variable than impervious spaces.

%This suggests that: average temperature difference across sites is several degrees at most, spatial variability lower at 6 am than at 4pm (PUT NUMBERS HERE), and green spaces more variable than non-green spaces This implies that temperature variability within the urban heat island is lower than suggested by satellite land surface temperature products. Futhermore, as semi-variograms fit to are used in Kreiging spatial estimation technique this suggests that the simple Kreiging model would accurately model temperature data in an urban setting.

\subsubsection{Vegetation}
Having addressed spatial variability, we now turn to its cause. We have shown how temperature varies by land type; as one differing factor between land types is the presence of vegetation, we next quantify the relationship between temperature and green infrastructure in Baltimore. 
%Green infrastructure is one commonly cited means to combat urban heating (cite EPA toolkit), so we next evaluate the connection between temperature and green infrastructure in Baltimore. 
%There are many types of green infrastructure, in Baltimore, parks, fields, and forested areas are common. We find that 
%observations in green sites are significantly cooler than impervious sites. This is particularly true at 6 am, when $\overline{T}_{green} = $ and $\overline{T}_{imp} = $.
%However, green sites are more variable: $\sigma_{green} = $ whereas $\sigma_{imp} = $. This indicates that using green infrastructure as a heat mitigation strategy may vary in both timing and effectiveness. 
Because there is no common index for assessing green infrastructure, we turn to satellite-measured NDVI, a proxy for photosynthetic activity that can indicate the presence of vegetation as a continuous variable. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:veg} we examine the relationship between NDVI and time-averaged temperature at all hours, at 6am, and at 4pm, and find that variability in NDVI is an important factor in determining spatial variability of air temperature. In all cases, there is a negative relationship between NDVI and temperature, indicating that vegetation (as observed from above by satellite) is related to cooler temperatures. This relationship is strongest at 6am ($r = -0.68$, $p< 0.05$) and weakest at 4pm ($r= -0.21$, $p<0.05$). Correspondingly, we see that the most developed land types have the lowest values of NDVI, and that the least developed types have higher values of NDVI, though there is a wide range of variability and overlap between the land types. 

\subsubsection{Diurnal}
We next turn to the diurnal variability in temperature. Figure~\ref{fig:diurnal}a shows hourly temperature averaged over sites in each different land type. As suggested by \ref{fig:hist}, high intensity land the hottest land type at every hour, and coolest sites throughout the day are located in rural forests. Urban forests retain heat at night compared to rural forests, remaining hotter than medium and low intensity land types at 6am, but are much cooler during the daytime, staying cooler at 4pm than all developed land types. 
The temperature differences between sites give rise to a temperature difference, $\Delta T$, between urban, developed sites and the rural, forested sits (Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal}b). In all land types, this temperature difference is largest in the early morning hours and diminishes throughout the day. The average $\Delta T$ ranges from X to X
% add values here
and is highest for high intensity land throughout the day. Open space and rural forests have the lowest temperature difference with respect to rural observations. Open space $\Delta T$ remains fairly constant throughout the day, with a slight increase at 6am and subsequent decrease at 9am, indicating an offset in diurnal temperature cycle timing compared to rural forests. It is possible this is attributable to faster heating in open areas due to more open geometry and less shading. 

% consider possibly moving this to a separate figure/paragraph? 


Our land use categorizes sites based on satellite data at a scale of 1km. Sub-kilometer spatial variability is also present, often in the form of presence or absence of local vegetation, such as street trees, small parks, and vegetation like grass or other low plants. Having established that large-scale vegetation affects temperature, we now turn to local site vegetation that is too small to be captured by satellites. In Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal_urbanforests_etc}, we look at diurnal temperature variability for local site vegetation characteristics within developed land types. We see that sites with vegetation present are cooler than those without. Sites dominated by impervious land and having no local vegetation are the hottest. Sites with impervious land and trees (\textit{ie}, street trees in residential areas) are cooler, and parks with trees even cooler. The coolest sites are in urban forests. Urban forests are warmer at night than rural areas by several degrees. By 10am, this difference decreases to X$^\circ$C

and remains the coolest until 6pm, at which time the differences start to go away.  Thus, in addition to land use, vegetation variability at sub-kilometer variability affects temperature.

We have shown that urban temperature is spatially auto-correlated at both night and day. One question relevant to decision makers is how far the cooling benefit of parks and trees persists. That is, if two sites are close by, and one site is a site with green infrastructure causing a lower temperature, how far does that cooling benefit extend? We address this question in Fig.~X, which plots each site's distance from a nearby park versus its mean temperature for $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$. We see that while $T_{min}$ is positively correlated with park distance ($r=0.5$, $p< 0.05$), $T_{max}$ shows no significant relationship ($p>0.05$).  We quantify the cooling by distance using a linear regression and find that cooling benefits decay outside of parks by x$^\circ C$/km. This suggests that parks can offer cooling nighttime cooling benefits to surrounding neighborhoods, but that daytime cooling benefits are unclear beyond park boundaries.

\subsection{Observation discussion}
We have examined Baltimore's urban heat island using a dense network of thermometers and seen that temperature's spatial variability is around $1^\circ$C, though significant differences in temperature are attributed to land use. We find high intensity land to be the hottest and rural forest land the coolest. We find that temperature exhibits spatial auto-correlation that increases linearly with distance, and doesn't appear to reach a maximum within the distances examined (25 km). Urban-rural temperature differences are highest in the morning and are lower throughout the day, with higher intensity land exhibiting higher values of $\Delta T$. Cooler temperatures are linked with satellite-derived vegetation in the morning, but shows a weak relationship with cooler afternoon temperatures.  
Sub-kilometer scale variability in vegetation also affects temperature: the presence of local trees, grass, or other vegetation is linked with cooler temperatures. While street trees are attributed to slightly lower temperatures than areas with no green infrastructure, urban forests provide the most daytime cooling and open areas filled with grass or other low vegetation provide the most nighttime cooling. Additionally, nighttime temperature decreases with distance from parks. 
These results suggest that: greening strategies that enhance parks, street trees or vegetation, enacted both on large scales (1km) or small scales (<1km) have the potential to cool the city, but that whether the city experiences nighttime or daytime cooling depends on the greening strategy. This is particularly true for nighttime temperatures, rather than daytime temperatures. Urban forests, by contrast, may provide daytime cooling benefits.
 
\subsection{Model}
Many cities lack access to a network of temperature sensors, so numerical models can play an important role in answering science and policy questions. This leads us to examine how well one such model, WRF, captures the important aspects of Baltimore's urban heat island identified above. 
\subsubsection{Evaluation Statistics}
We evaluate the numerical simulations with respect to 2-meter atmospheric temperature. In order to assess how well the model reproduces temporal variability, we first compare spatially-averaged temperature observations to spatially-averaged modeled temperature. Table~\ref{tab:time_error} reports these results for several statistics for data from all hours, 6am, 4pm, $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$.  We find that the overall error due to time is low---for data from all hours, the RMSE (4.6) is within the range reported by the literature. 
% add these values here. 
The modeled data is highly correlated with observations ($r=0.89$, $p<0.05$) and has a low percent bias ($pbias = 0.78$). The mean index of agreement is close to one ($mioa=0.93$), indicating good agreement between hourly model and observational data.
Compared with all hours, the RMSE for 6am data is lower (4.15) than that for all hours, suggesting that simulations at 6am better match observations. However, the other statistics indicate worse performance:  the correlation is lower $r=0.84$, the index of agreement is lower $mioa=0.83$, and the percent bias has a large absolute value ($pbias=-6.38$), indicating that the model underestimates temperature with respect to observations. 
The error statistics for 4pm data show worse model agreement for than that for hourly data and 6am data, with the highest mean error out of any category we examine ($rmse=6.04$). The correlation is similarly low ($r=0.76$), though both the percent bias and index of agreement show better model-observation agreement than of those for 6am data ($pbias=2.55$, $mioa=0.85$). This indicates that while overall statistics show that our simulation is in line with reported error, statistics at specific hours show worse agreement, and the model both underestimates temperature in the morning and overestimates temperature in the afternoon. Bias is particularly strong during the daytime hours, with the poorest agreement at 4pm or for $T_{max}$. 

It may be possible that observations and the model have slightly altered diurnal cycles due to irregular canyon geometry in the observations. To allow for the possibility of this in our model evaluation, we also examine error statistics for minimum and maximum daily temperatures $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$. The mean error for $T_{min}$, $rmse=3.94$ is lower than of that for 6am, and the percent bias has a lower absolute value ($pbias=-5.67$), indicating better agreement when the diurnal cycles are shifted. However, the correlation is slightly lower ($r=0.82$) and the mean index of agreement is very similar ($mioa=.82$), indicating that this improvement is minimal. The mean error for $T_{max}$ is the lowest mean error reported ($rmse=2.87$); similarly, the correlation is the highest reported ($r=0.9$). The percent bias is higher than that for 4pm data ($pbias=3.31$), and the index of agreement is similar to that for 4pm data ($mioa=0.93$).
Thus, while maximum and minimum statistics show some indication of a different diurnal cycles between observations and modeled data, they generally agree with hourly error statistics in sign and magnitude and so we conclude that a shifted diurnal cycle does not account for most of the error.

Next, we compare time-averaged observations to simulations to assess how spatial variability in the model may contribute to error (Tab.~\ref{tab:space_error}). Overall spatial error and percent bias is low for all hours ($rmse=0.93$, $pbias=0.78$), though so is the correlation and corresponding coefficient of determination ($r=0.64$, $r^2=0.41$), indicating non-linearity in the model-observation relationship. The mean index of agreement is lower than that for temporal error, however, indicating worse agreement. 
As with the temporal error, the spatial error is higher for data at selected hours of the day than for all hours. For 6am data, $rmse=3.32$ and $pbias=-6.38$, indicating the model underestimates temperature by several degrees. While this is an improvement over the 6am temporal error, $r=0.5$ (and correspondingly, $r^2 = 0.25$), indicating significant variability over space. Error statistics for 4pm data show poorer model agreement than for 6am data, with a higher RMSE ($rmse = 3.7$) and lower correlation ($r=0.36$) and corresponding coefficient of determination ($r^2 = 0.21$). The percent bias has a smaller absolute value, indicating that the model overestimates 4pm temperature ($pbias=2.55$). 

We also address the possibility that an altered diurnal cycle affects spatial error by calculating error statistics for $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$. We see that error statistics for $T_{min}$ show slightly better agreement than for 6am data: the RMSE is slightly lower ($rmse = 2.74$), the correlation is slightly higher ($r=0.54$), the percent bias has a lower absolute magnitude ($pbias=-5.76$), and the index of agreement is higher ($mioa=0.57$). By contrast, error statistics for $T_{max}$ show poorer agreement than for 4pm data: 
the RMSE and bias are higher ($rmse=6.09$, $pbias=3.31$) and the correlation, index of agreement and coefficient of determination are lower ($r=0.4$, $mioa=0.42$, $r^2=0.16$). 
This indicates that while morning processes may occur at the incorrect time, the model incorrectly captures the timing of $T_{max}$ and overestimates its magnitude. 

For all spatial statistics, we note that by matching observation sites to the closest grid points rather than interpolating may introduce additional error, meaning that these error statistics may underestimate model performance. That error statistics for spatial error generally show better model-observation agreement than do the error statistics for temporal error suggests that while the model struggles to capture the observed synoptic temperature patterns, internal spatial structure of the urban heat island is well described.

Using summary statistics is one way to evaluate model performance. Having seen that these statistics suggest performance in line with that reported by the literature, we now turn to a detailed evaluation according to the important characteristics of Baltimore's urban heat island. In all cases, we compare 2-meter temperature.
\subsubsection{Histogram}
Figure~\ref{fig:hist}b) shows histograms of spatially averaged temperatures at each site grouped by land types.
% note: calcluate this 
First, we examine the statistical distribution of time mean temperatures at each site. Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}X shows this for data averaged over all hours by land type. As in observations, higher intensity land types are hotter than lower intensity land types, with high intensity land hottest, and rural forests coolest. High intensity land is significantly warmer than other land types and its distribution does not overlap with other land types, unlike observations, though other land types do have overlapping distributions. The distributions are less variable, in contrast with observations: standard deviations for all land types are $0.2^\circ$C or less. This suggests that the model underestimates the spatial variability present in observations, though as the model in a sense averages over each numerical grid box, this is not unexpected. 
Distributions of mean 6am temperatures (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}) resemble those at all hours in that the distribution of high intensity land does not overlap with other land types and that higher intensity developed land types are hotter than lower intensity land types. The notable exception to this is rural forests, which on average are warmer than open space and medium and low intensity land types. Variability is highest for rural forests ($\sigma = 0.4$), and in all cases lower than of that for observations. Distributions of mean 4pm temperatures (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}) for high intensity land remain warmest, and show more overlap among land types. These distributions are right-skewed, and in all cases, warmer than observations. Similarly, variability is much lower. As with overall statistics of spatial variability, this may not be surprising as observations come from a variety of micro-climates whereas models inherently average sub-gridscale variability. Thus, these comparison of the distributions of observed and modeled temperature show that there are significant differences between models and observations. Modeled temperature is colder in mornings, and warmer in the evenings than observations, while expressing little of the variability within or between land types. 

\subsubsection{Semi-variograms}
We have shown how modeled temperature has low spatial variability (<$1^\circ$C) compared with observations. We next examine how the spatial auto-correlation changes as a function of distance. Fig.~\ref{fig:semiv_model}a shows semi-variograms (semi-variance  by distance) for data at 6am. The semi-variogram has a nugget of X$^\circ$C, indicating that points within one kilometer or less of each other vary by a little under 1$^\circ$C. Semi-variance increases with distance at a linear rate, and it is unclear if the semi-variogram reaches a sill or not. This indicates that temperature within the modelled urban heat island varies little, by $1^\circ$C or less. This is similar to the observed semi-variogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:semiv_obs}a, where semi-variorance appears to increase with distance beyond 20km. The semi-variogram for 4pm temperatures (Fig.~\ref{fig:semiv_model}) shows that semi-variance remains constant or slightly increases with distance, indicating that modelled point similarity increases constantly with distance. The nugget is $1^\circ$C, indicating that there sub-gridscale variability causes neighboring gridpoints to vary by about $1^\circ$C. 
% comparison with observation 
The modeled semi-variograms have similar shapes to the observed semi-variograms, indicating that the model is accurately capturing spatial auto-correlation in urban temperature. %Thus, we conclude that errors in spatial variability 

\subsubsection{Vegetation}
Observed temperature shows a negative correlation with satellite-measured vegetation. We test this relationship in the model by comparing temperature to vegetation fraction $VF$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:veg}b,d,f for temperature at all hours, 6am, and 4pm. While NDVI is not explicitly a fraction of vegetation in that it does not reach a maximum of 1 in practice, NDVI is comparable to VF in the qualitative sense that they both express a greenness fraction. In the model, $VF$ ranges from 60\% to 90\% or is set to zero. While each land type has a variety of vegetative fractions, the model is not expressing the range of variability seen in observations in low-vegetation environments. This is particularly true for higher intensity land types: for example, high intensity land either has VF of either 0 or 0.6. Nonetheless, the model still captures the negative relationship between temperature and vegetation: for all hours, $r= -0.49$, similar to observations. 6am temperature is slightly less correlated with vegetation than observations ($r= -0.59$), but 4pm temperature is more correlated with vegetation than observations ($r= -0.48$). This suggests that the model may 

\subsubsection{Diurnal}
As discussed earlier, it is possible that the model may simply have a different diurnal cycle than observations which may cause statistics taken from a single hour (\textit{i.e.}, 6am or 4pm) to underestimate model performance. To address this, we examine the diurnal variability in temperature by land use, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal}c. At all sites, modeled temperature reaches its minimum at 6am and acheives maximum temperature around noon, cooling slightly until X pm,
% values here 
 at which point temperatures cool rapidly throughout the night. Temperature in high intensity land is X degrees 
 %fill in 
 warmer than other land types during the night, with  This contrasts with temperature observations in several ways: first, $T_{min}$ is too cold, second, $T_{max}$ is too early, and third, $T_{max}$ is too hot. That is, the model exaggerates the range of the diurnal cycle with respect to observations, and incorrectly reproduces the timing of the diurnal temperature cycle. Additionally, high intensity temperature differs too much from other land types at night, while other land types are too similar for all of the day except the afternoon through early evening. 
 
 This has implications for urban-rural temperature differences. The diurnal cycle of modeled $\Delta T$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal} d, and reaches a maximum around 7pm and a minimum at 9am for high intensity land and 5am for other types of land. $\Delta T$ for high intensity land remains greater than 1$^\circ$C throughout the day, whereas $\Delta T$ in medium/low intensity land and open space is negative in the early morning, eventually growing to X$^\circ C$ at 7pm. Their temperature maximum lags that of high intensity land by one hour. This is in sharp contrast to observations, which are warmer in the morning and grow cooler into the evening and night. Thus, the model incorrectly produces the magnitude and timing of the diurnal $\Delta T$ cycle. % which may have implications on using the model to understand green infrastructure

\subsubsection{ Energy Budget}
% 4. The longterm flux balance should be $r_{net}=LW_{down}-LW_{up}+SW_{down}-SW_{up}=LH+HFLX-GRD$
In order to understand what causes the differences in temperature between each land type, we turn to the surface energy budget. In Fig.~\ref{fig:seb}a, we show the diurnal cycle of the net instantaneous forcing $F$ averaged over the summertime for each land type. Sensible heat is highest for high intensity land and lowest for rural forests. The reverse is true for latent heating, which is highest for rural forests and lowest for urban areas. That sensible and latent heating work in opposite senses, in the rural areas there's more moisture and thus more evaporation. But the sum of the turbulent heat fluxes (sensible and latent heat) is larger in rural than urban areas, so that more energy is lost to the atmosphere via these fluxes, resulting in more cooling. The ground flux removes more heat from the surface in urban areas than in rural areas, partially offsetting the increased turbulent heat flux in rural areas. The incoming radiative forcing may exhibit some differences between the urban and rural areas, but these are small. 
The net instantaneous forcing in rural forests is higher during the day, but becomes smaller at night, and explains why rural and less developed areas cool faster at night. 
As the model exaggerates the intensity of the diurnal cycle, future studies should examine the...

%We see that $F$ is highest for  High intensity land, with medium, low and open space having the same net flux. Rural forests show the lowest net flux. Error bars show that for each land type, there is little spatial variability.  
%To diagnose why, we turn to the components of the surface energy budget (eq.~\ref{eq:seb}). The sensible heat flux (Fig.~\ref{fig:seb}b) is highest for high intensity land, and lowest for the rural forest.

\subsection{Model Discussion}
Numerical simulations of Baltimore's urban heat island produce errors within the range reported by the literature. However, a closer examination of hourly temperature, diurnal urban rural temperature differences, and the relationship between land use or vegetation and temperature reveals that the model poorly captures several important aspects of Baltimore's urban heat island. 
We find that error due to temporal variability is higher than that due to spatial variability, indicating that the model captures the spatial variability and extent of the urban heat island, though it poorly resolves the synoptic weather patterns. Higher hourly error statistics indicate that the model exaggerates the diurnal temperature range, underestimating morning temperatures and overestimating afternoon temperatures. 
 Semi-variograms indicate that while the model significantly underestimates urban temperature's spatial variability, the model captures the patterns of spatial auto-correlation well. When we separate the distributions of temperature by land type, though the model correctly reproduces that higher intensity land types are warmer, we see significant difference from observations in that distributions of each land type do not overlap and show much less variability. 
 The  inccorect shape of the modeled diurnal temperature cycle causes the diurnal cycle of $\Delta T$ to be the opposite of observations: while we observe that urban-rural differences are largest in the morning and grow smaller during the day, the model suggests that morning $\Delta T$ is low or even negative and that $\Delta T$ is largest at night. 

The model also underestimates the distribution of vegetative fraction, particularly in high intensity land types. While it correctly captures the negative relationship between vegetation and temperature at 6am, it overestimates that same relationship at 4pm. This has possible policy ramifications. While the model suggests that greening policies can affect afternoon temperature, observations indicate that vegetation is only weakly linked with afternoon temperatures.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
Observations from an urban network of thermometers reveal several key characteristics of Baltimore's urban heat island. Spatial variability is around $1^\circ$C and attributed to land type, with higher intensity land hotter. We can link cooler temperatures both with the presence of large scale and local vegetation; this relationship is greater at 6am than at 4pm, when the correlation is low. The diurnal cycle shows that urban-rural differences $\Delta T$ are highest at 6am and lowest at 4pm, but vary by land type. We use these results to evaluate a numerical simulation of Baltimore in WRF, and show that while evaluation statistics such as the RMSE are in line with other studies reported in the literature, the model fails to capture many of the observed characteristics. In particular, the model incorrectly diagnoses the diurnal cycle of temperature and $\Delta T$ and over-estimates the daytime relationship between vegetation and temperature. 

Our results demonstrate that green infrastructure such as parks, street tress, or urban forests can cool the urban heat island, and that different green types cool at different times of day: urban forests cool the most during the day, while parks offer the most cooling at night. While our numerical model has a low overall error compared with urban heat island observations, it does not capture either the timing or intensity of the diurnal cycle of temperature and urban-rural differences, and overestimates the relationship between daytime temperature and vegetation. This suggests that care must be taken when using numerical models to understand urban heat island processes and to prescribe urban heat island mitigation policies. In addition to evaluating the overall model error and bias, it is important to evaluate the ability of any urban heat island model to describe key observed features of that urban heat island. 

While our study focuses on one type of numerical model, our results show the limitations of understanding urban heat island process through numerical models and demonstrates that it is not sufficient to assume that a low bias and error indicate that the model accurately represents the urban heat island.  While some previous studies report basic UHI features, such as the diurnal UHI cycle, many studies do not. Similarly, no studies investigating the role of green infrastructure in urban heat island mitigation were found to first validate the ability of their model to capture this relationship. We call on future studies to expand their evaluation metrics for urban heat island studies.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}

% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one e  quation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
