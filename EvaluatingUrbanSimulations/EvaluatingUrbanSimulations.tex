\begin{abstract}
Understanding the urban heat island is important for policy and health. Urban simulations are often evaluated using a few observation stations. While many papers are motivated by policy concerns, their evaluation metrics do not reflect this. We first identify several critical characteristics of Baltimore's UHI using a novel dataset collected by over 100 low-cost thermometer/hygrometers. We evaluate the model using these characteristics and show that WRF fails to capture several UHI properties that are important.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Heat exposure is one of the deadliest forms of climate hazards. Rising global temperatures raise the public health and economic consequences of heat exposure. In the US, an average of 600 people a year die from heat exposure. In resource-poor settings, the death toll is even higher. 

Urban alterations to the natural landscape raise temperatures, a phenomena known as the urban heat island that is one of the most significant ways in which humans alter the atmosphere (Kai or Zhou? and Kalnay). This creates the possibility that cities may be more affected by the consequences of heat exposure than outlying rural areas. 

Urban simulations using the WRF (Chen 2011) modeling system have been evaluated using data from cities around the world and climate zones ranging from desert to sub-tropical. All studies conclude that WRF performs well for modelling the urban environment, with mean RMSEs for 2-meter temperature being reported as ranging from $0.6-4.0^\circ C$. Fewer studies evaluate the model at the resolution at which it is run. 

Additionally, the UHI literature is not aligned with policy priorities of urban planners. Policy literature suggests that there is interest in incorporating urban heat island mitigation into long term planning \cite{shickman2016current}. However, much of the UHI literature focuses on attributing and understanding the causes of urban heating, while UHI mitigation is less studied \cite{huang2018urban}; accordingly, cities cite a lack of local data and knowledge as hindering their progress \cite{hewitt2014cool}. Thus, understanding policy priorities is key to aiding urban heat mitigation efforts. 

Cities list mitigating the impacts of heatwaves a key motivator of urban heat mitigation policies \citep{hewitt2014cool}. Thus, urban modeling studies simulating heat waves should focus their evaluation on metrics related to heatwaves. 

Our paper focuses on using our observations and models to answer policy questions we find least addressed by previous studies. We identify several questions of interest to the policy maker and see how well WRF does at answering these questions: 

To address these questions, we quantify answers to the following questions: 
1) How does urban heat island intensity vary throughout the day? 
2) How variable is urban temperature? 
3) How does landcover affect urban heat island intensity? 
4) How does urban heat intensity vary during heatwaves? 

In this study, we use a novel observational data set to analyze temperature variability in Baltimore, Md. and evaluate a numerical simulation. This 

\section{Literature Review}

We examined the 50 most cited papers which use or cite the Weather, Research, and Forecasting (WRF) Model (Chen 2011). Most of these studies use WRF to model the urban environment for the purposes of... 

In this sample of the literature, authors evaluate the accuracy of WRF in different ways. This includes using observations of temperature (eg, \citet{}), wind, humidity, precipitation, pollutant concentrations \citep{}, and energy fluxes. Evaluations occur at the surface, in the near-surface atmosphere, as well as aloft using atmospheric profilers and flight campaigns. In the case of surface observations, studies compared data from the model pixel located nearest to the observation station. Statistical metrics such as RMSE, correlation, bias, hit rate, index of agreement, coefficient of determination are used to quantifying model agreement with observations.  

Cities examined included Asian agglomerations of Shanghai, Singapore, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, North American cities of Phoenix, Houston, Los Angeles, and Baltimore-Washington, and European cities of Paris, London, and Rotterdam. The only Southern Hemisphere city examined was Sydney, Australia \cite{argueso2014temperature}. One study examined an fictional, idealized city in continental Europe \citep{theeuwes2014seasonal}, and several studies examined multiple sites. No cities in Africa, South America, or Central or Southern Asia were included in this sample.  Several areas have been examined multiple times: Baltimore-Washington, Shanghai, 

Several of these studies focus on evaluation of WRF by varying parameterizations or boundary layer physics options. Most studies use WRF as a tool to understand physical processes that drive urban temperature or weather events. Others use WRF to explore UHI mitigation measures. A common question was quantifying the role of urbanization in temperature trends.

While all of these papers examined urban temperature, only 13 explicitly examined urban-rural differences. Of these, even fewer used urban-rural differences as an evaluation metric. \citet{li2013synergistic} examined UHI. 
Other UHI characteristics, such as the spatial variability of temperature, were not used to evaluate simulations. 

Of the papers that used WRF as a tool to explore urban heating mitigation measures,

\subsection{Observations}
Temperature observations in this paper come from a network of iButton thermometer/hygrometers located throughout the Greater Baltimore area (Fig.~\ref{fig:map}b). Baltimore is a mid-sized American city with a small, central downtown core of buildings greater than three stories, neighborhoods dominated by two-three story brick rowhomes, and outlying higher-elevation neighborhoods and suburbs with grass lawns, multi-level detached homes, and trees. Tree canopy covered 28 percent of Baltimore in 2015.

iButtons were installed in 91 sites beginning in May 2016, with the full network installed by July 1, 2016; at the end of the summer, 85 sensors remained. Thus, in this study we examine data taken between July 1, 2016 and August 30, 2016. Nearly all sites (79) were located within Baltimore City; the remaining 6 were north of the city in Baltimore County. During installation, local site data was taken on the surrounding site characteristics: 24 sensors were located in locations dominated by impervious surfaces, 43 were located in locations with grass and low vegetation, 13 sensors with bare or little ground-cover, and 5 sites with a mix of these characteristics. 

Thermometers were housed in a custom shield in a custom, naturally aspirated radiation shield made of WhiteOptics White98 Reflector Film and attached to trees and poles as in Fig.~\ref{fig:ibutton}a using a plastic zip-tie. Out of the 85 sensors, 61 sensors were attached to trees, 17 sensors were attached to metal poles, and 7 were attached to wooden posts. Most of these were estimated to be located in partial shade (38) or full shade (24); the remaining were located in full sun (23). 

Each observation site was given a land use type from the 40-class Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land type included in WRF. These include high intensity, medium and low intensity, open space, and deciduous forest land types. Table \ref{tab:lcc} shows their corresponding MODIS classifications-for example, we combine the developed, medium intensity classification (MODIS 25) with the developed, low intensity classification (MODIS 24) to make our medium and low intensity category. We also add an urban forest classification, not described by MODIS but available from our own \textit{in situ} site description. For developed land types, this study includes 20-30 sites for each category; only 3 sites are included in the rural/forest area. 

These site classifications correspond to a range of possible vegetative fractions. In order to calculate vegetation fractions quantitatively, we calculate satellite observations of Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI), the normalized difference of near-infrared light $NIR$ to visible red light $VIS$: 
\[NDVI = \frac{NIR-VIS}{NIR+VIS}\]
at each observation site. The data is downloaded from Landsat-8 using the Google Earth Engine platform. We selected the least cloudy scene during the period June 1, 2016- August 15, 2016. 

iButtons have been evaluated in the literature () and have been reported to agree well particularly for nighttime temperatures, but exhibit a warm bias (). Thus, we co-locate one of the iButtons with an Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) station in downtown Baltimore. This station provides sub-hourly measurements with reported accuracies of $< 0.5^\circ $C. In Fig.\ref{fig:bias}, we compare the ASOS measurements with the iButton measurement. We find that the measurements agree well--the mean difference (iButtons-ASOS) is $0.44^\circ$C the distributions of summertime temperatures for all hours (Fig.~\ref{fig:bias}a) is similar, and the correlation for the two instruments is $r = 0.96$. 

However, hourly measurements agree less well: the 6am error is $-0.29^\circ$C, and the 4pm error is $1.18^\circ$C. The average summertime hourly temperature, Fig.~\ref{fig:bias}c), shows that in addition to a overestimate of afternoon temperature, the diurnal temperature cycle differs between the instruments. Whereas the iButton indicates that $T_{min}$ occurs at 6am, the ASOS instrument indicates 5am. This is also born out in the fact that the mean error for $T_{min}$ is lower than for 6am data, though the same is not true for $T_{max}$ and 4pm data. In order to compensate for this instrument bias, we subtract the hourly difference between the iButton and the ASOS station as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bias}c) from each iButton instrument on each day

\subsection{Numerical Model}
This paper uses the Weather, Research, and Forecasting Model (WRF) vx.x. Get Hamada to help fill in here. 

In this paper, we refer to the following variables from the model: 2-meter temperature (T2),
 land-use type (LU INDEX), latent heat (LH), 
 sensible heat (HFX), ground flux (GRDFLX), 
incoming shortwave radiation (SWDNB),
reflected outgoing shortwave radiation (SWUPB), 
reflected incoming longwave radiation (LWDNB) and outgoing longwave radiation (LWUPB).  We compute the net energy flux $F$ as

\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:seb}
F= r_{net} -LH - HFX - GRDFLX
\end{equation}
where the net radiation flux $$r_{net}=LWDNB-LWUPB + SWNDB-SWUPB$$. 
  
\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluate the simulated 2-meter temperature against the observation in the nearest grid box using several statistical methods. First, the root-mean squared error $RMSE$, comparing observations $O_i$ to simulation data $S_i$:  
\begin{equation}%\label{eq:rmse}
RMSE = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(S_i - O_i\right)^2
\end{equation}
. The $RMSE$ in this case has units of $^\circ$C$^2$. Next, we examine the Pearson correlation $r$ and its corresponding p-value $p$, indicating the probability that the given correlation is due to chance. The coefficient of determination, $r^2$. We also examine the Modified Index of Agreement or $MIOA$ (Willmott 1981), varying between \(0\) and \(1\), with \(1\) indicating a perfect match and zero indicating no match: 
\begin{equation}
md = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(O_{i}-S_{i})^{j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}|(S_{i}-\bar{O})|+|(O_{i}-\bar{O})|^{j}}
%\label{eq:modified_index_of_agreement}
\end{equation}
where $j=1$. 
Then, we calculate the percent bias (PBIAS), where a value of zero is a perfect match; positive values indicate that the iButton is overestimating the reading while negative values indicate that the sensor is underestimating the reading.
\begin{equation}
PBIAS = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(O_{i}-S_{i})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}O_{i}}*100
%\label{eq:pbias}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Statistics}
To quantify spatial variability within the urban heat island, we calculate the semi-variance. The semi-variance provides a measure of spatial variance as a function of distance; it indicates an average difference between two data points $f(a), f(a+h)$ given their distance apart $h$: 
$$ s(h) = \frac{1}{2 N(h)} \sum _{N(h)} \left(f(a+h) -f(a)\right)^2 $$
Here, we calculate the experimental semi-variance by making $h$ a discrete variable equal to fixed-width distances of 1 km for modelled data and .1 km for observed data. 

To separate temporal error from error induced by spatial variability, we we calculate each of the above metrics for spatially average temperature and temporally averaged temperature. We refer to temporally averaged temperature as $\overline{T}$ and spatially averaged temperature as $\langle T \rangle$. 
\section{Results}\label{sec:results} 
\subsection{Observations}
\subsubsection{Histogram}
Temperature in summer 2016 ranged from X-X degrees, with an average temperature of X. In comparison with past years, this summer was warmer/cooler/average. Land use affects temperature, and temperature in different sites have different temperatures. Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}a) shows histograms of mean temperature for all hours at each site grouped by land types. For each land type, temperatures are normally  distributed. 
High intensity land use is hottest, with a mean temperature of X. Medium and low intensity land is cooler, and rural forests are coolest. The standard deviation of temperature is less than 1$^\circ$C in all cases, with open space having the highest standard deviation ($\sigma = 0.89^\circ$ C). We repeat this analysis for mean 6am temperatures in Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}b) and see that similarly, higher intensity land types are hotter than lower intensity land types, with high intensity land the hottest, and rural forest the least hot. Temperatures at 4pm (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}c) are more variable than those at 6am, with medium and low intensity land types having the highest variability ($\sigma = 1.92$). 
% Note: add urban forest or urban green category here? 

\subsubsection{Semi-variograms}
Next, we examine spatial variability. The time-averaged standard deviation of all data is  We next examine how different locations vary from one aonther. Figure Xa shows a semi-variogram: the semi-variance (in units of variance or $^\circ$C$^2$ )is plotted against distance for all locations at 6am. For sites within one kilometer of one another, the semi-variance is less than 0.50.5, which translates to temperature differences of 0.7∘0.7∘C on average. As distance between sites increases, the semi-variance increases linearly, indicating that farther away points are more and more dissimilar. While the semi-variance is noisier at longer distances, this is due to having fewer datapoints at certain distances. This may be why the semi-variogram is exceeds its theoretical limit of the sample variance for some of the distances between 15-25 kilometers. Overall, we see that sites closer together are more similar and farther sites are more dissimilar.

\subsubsection{Diurnal}
We next turn to the diurnal variability in temperature. Figure~\ref{fig:diurnal}a shows hourly temperature averaged over sites in each different land type. As suggested by \ref{fig:hist}, high intensity land the hottest land type at every hour, and coolest sites throughout the day are located in rural forests. Urban forests retain heat at night compared to rural forests, remaining hotter than medium and low intensity land types at 6am, but are much cooler during the daytime, staying cooler at 4pm than all developed land types. 
The temperature differences between sites give rise to a temperature difference, $\Delta T$, between urban, developed sites and the rural, forested sits (Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal}b). In all land types, this temperature difference is largest in the early morning hours and diminishes throughout the day. The average $\Delta T$ ranges from X to X
% add values here
and is highest for high intensity land throughout the day. Open space and rural forests have the lowest temperature difference with respect to rural observations. Open space $\Delta T$ remains fairly constant throughout the day, with a slight increase at 6am and subsequent decrease at 9am. It is possible this is attributable to faster heating in open areas due to more open geometry and less shading. Urban forests, by contrast, are warmer at night than rural areas by several degrees. By 10am, this difference decreases to X$^\circ$C 
% add values here
and remains the coolest until 6pm, at which time the differences start to go away. 

\subsubsection{Vegetation}
We have shown how temperature varies by land type and presence of vegetation. We can link some of this spatial variability inside the urban heat island to the abundance of vegetation. In Fig.~\ref{fig:veg} we examine the relationship between NDVI and temperature at all hours, at 6am, and at 4pm, and find that variability in NDVI is an important factor in determining spatial variability of air temperature. In all cases, there is a negative relationship between NDVI and temperature, indicating that vegetation (as observed from above by satellite) is related to cooler temperatures. This relationship is strongest at 6am ($r = -0.68$, $p< 0.05$) and weakest at 4pm ($r= -0.21$, $p<0.05$). Correspondingly, we see that the most developed land types have the lowest values of NDVI, and that the least developed types have higher values of NDVI, though there is a wide range of variability and overlap between the land types. 

Our land use categorizes sites based on satellite data at a scale of 1km. Sub-kilometer spatial variability is also present, often in the form of presence or absence of local vegetation, such as street trees, small parks, and vegetation like grass or other low plants. In Figure X, we look at diurnal temperature variability for local site vegetation characteristics within developed land types. We see that sites with vegetation present are cooler than those without. Sites dominated by impervious land and having no local vegetation are the hottest. Sites with impervious land and trees (\textit{ie}, street trees in residential areas) are less hot... The coolest sites are in urban forests. Thus, in addition to land use, vegetation variability at sub-kilometer variability affects temperature.

\subsection{Observation discussion}

These results suggest that: greening strategies that enhance parks, street trees or vegetation, enacted both on large scales (1km) or small scales (<1km) have the potential to cool the city. This is particularly true for nighttime temperatures, rather than daytime temperatures. Urban forests, by contrast, may provide daytime cooling benefits.
 
\subsection{Model}
\subsubsection{Evaluation Statistics}
We first evaluate the numerical simulations with respect to 2-meter atmospheric temperature. First, we examine spatially-averaged temperature observations to spatially-averaged modelled temperature to assess how well the model reproduces temporal variability. Table~\ref{tab:time_error} reports these results for several statistics for data from all hours, 6am, 4pm, and $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$. For hourly data, the RMSE (4.6) is within the range reported by the literature. 
% add these values here. 
The modeled data is highly correlated with observations ($r=0.89$, $p<0.05$) and a low percent bias ($pbias = 0.78$). The mean index of agreement is close to one ($mioa=0.93$), indicating good agreement between hourly model and observational data.
Compared with all hours, the RMSE for 6am data is lower (4.15) than that for all hours, suggesting that simulations at 6am better match observations. However, the other statistics indicate worse performance:  the correlation is lower $r=0.84$, the index of agreement is lower $mioa=0.83$, and the percent bias has a large absolute value ($pbias=-6.38$). A negative percent bias indicates that the model underestimates temperature with respect to observations. Comparisons with 4pm data perform poorer than hourly data and 6am data, with the highest mean error out of any category we examine ($rmse=6.04$). The correlation is similarly low ($r=0.76$), though both the percent bias and index of agreement are show better model-observation agreement than of those for 6am data ($pbias=2.55$, $mioa=0.85$).

It may be possible that observations and the model have slightly altered diurnal cycles due to irregular canyon geometry in the observations. To allow for the possibility of this in our model evaluation, we also examine error statistics for minimum and maximum daily temperatures $T_{min}$, $T_{max}$. The mean error for $T_{min}$, $rmse=3.94$ is lower than of that for 6am, and the percent bias has a lower absolute value ($pbias=-5.67$), indicating better agreement when the diurnal cycles are shifted. However, the correlation is slightly lower ($r=0.82$) and the mean index of agreement is very similar ($mioa=.82$), indicating that this improvement is minimal. The mean error for $T_{max}$ is the lowest mean error reported ($rmse=2.87$); similarly, the correlation is the highest reported ($r=0.9$). The percent bias is higher than that for 4pm data ($pbias=3.31$), and the index of agreement is similar to that for 4pm data ($mioa=0.93$), indicating 

Next, we compare time-averaged observations to simulations to assess how spatial variability in the model may contribute to error (Tab.~\ref{tab:space_error}). 
%%note: contextualize these values. rmse = accuracy, pbias= spread/variance, mioa = ???
%%

Using summary statistics is one way to evaluate model performance. Having seen that these statistics suggest performance in line with that reported by the literature, we now turn to a detailed evaluation according to the important characteristics of Baltimore's urban heat island. In all cases, we compare 2-meter temperature.
\subsubsection{Histogram}
First, we examine the statistical distribution of time mean temperatures at each site. Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}X shows this for data averaged over all hours and sorted by land type. As in observations, higher intensity land types are hotter than lower intensity land types, with high intensity land hottest, and rural forests coolest. High intensity land is significantly warmer than other land types and its distribution does not overlap with other land types, unlike observations, though other land types do have overlapping distributions. The distributions are less variable, in contrast with observations: standard deviations for all land types are $0.2^\circ$C or less. This suggests that the model underestimates the spatial variability present in observations, though as the model in a sense averages over the numerical grid, this is not unexpected. 

Distributions of mean 6am temperatures (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}) resemble those at all hours in that the distribution of high intensity land does not overlap with other land types and that higher intensity developed land types are hotter than lower intensity land types. The notable exception to this is rural forests, which on average are warmer than open space and medium and low intensity land types. Variability is highest for rural forests ($\sigma = 0.4$), and in all cases lower than of that for observations. Distributions of mean 4pm temperatures (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist}) for high intensity land remain warmest, and show more overlap amongst land types. These distributions are right-skewed, and in all cases, warmer than observations. Similarly, variability is much lower. Again, this may not be surprising as observations come from a variety of microclimates whereas models inherently average away that sub-gridscale variability through mixing parameterizations. 

Comparison of the distributions of observed and modeled temperature show that there are significant differences between models and observations. Modeled temperature is colder in mornings, and warmer in the evenings than observations, while expressing little of the variability within or between land types. 

\subsubsection{Semi-variograms}
We have shown how modeled temperature has low spatial variability (<$1^\circ$C) compared with observations. We next examine how the spatial variability changes as a function of distance. Fig.~\ref{fig:semiv_model}a shows semi-variograms (semi-variance  by distance) for data at 6am. The semi-variogram has a nugget of X$^\circ$C, indicating that points within one kilometer or less of each other vary by a little under 1$^\circ$C. Semi-variance increases with distance at a fairly linear rate

\subsubsection{Diurnal}
As discussed earlier, it is possible that the model may simply have a different diurnal cycle than observations which may cause statistics taken from a single hour (\textit{i.e.}, 6am or 4pm) to underestimate model performance. To address this, we examine the diurnal variability in temperature by land use, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal}c. At all sites, modeled temperature reaches its minimum at 6am and acheives maximum temperature around noon, cooling slightly until X pm,
% values here 
 at which point temperatures cool rapidly throughout the night. Temperature in high intensity land is X degrees 
 %fill in 
 warmer than other land types during the night, with  This contrasts with temperature observations in several ways: first, $T_{min}$ is too cold, second, $T_{max}$ is too early, and third, $T_{max}$ is too hot. That is, the model exaggerates the range of the diurnal cycle with respect to observations, and incorrectly reproduces the timing of the diurnal temperature cycle. Additionally, high intensity temperature differs too much from other land types at night, while other land types are too similar for all of the day except the afternoon through early evening. 
 
 This has implications for urban-rural temperature differences. The diurnal cycle of modeled $\Delta T$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diurnal} d, and reaches a maximum around 7pm and a minimum at 9am for high intensity land and 5am for other types of land. $\Delta T$ for high intensity land remains greater than 1$^\circ$C throughout the day, whereas $\Delta T$ in medium/low intensity land and open space is negative in the early morning, eventually growing to X$^\circ C$ at 7pm. Their temperature maximum lags that of high intensity land by one hour. This is in sharp contrast to observations, which are warmer in the morning and grow cooler into the evening and night. Thus, the model incorrectly produces the magnitude and timing of the diurnal $\Delta T$ cycle. % which may have implications on using the model to understand green infrastructure
 
 % note: add temperature labels on top and bottom of plots



\subsection{Semivariance/spatial variability}

It is possible that variability in the land type drives temperature variability. In Figure Xb, we look at sites dominated by impervious landcover at 6am and see that the variogram follows a similar pattern to that of Fig.~Xa: closer sites are similar and farther sites are dissimilar. At distances beyond 15km, the semi-variances remain close to the variance of X. This is in contrast with the semi-variogram for green landcovers at 6am (Fig.Xc). Though overall green sites have lower variance, the semi-variance increases with distance without evidence of a limit.

In the afternoon, variability is higher for variograms of all sites, impervious sites, and green sites at 6pm (Fig.Xd,e,f). The variance for all data, 3.9∘C3.9∘C (Fig.Xd), translates into an average temperature difference of 1.98∘∘ degrees, much higher than that at 6am. Impervious spaces remain dissimilar for the range of distances examined (Fig.~Xe). Greenspaces grow dissimilar at a constant rate, but remain less variable than impervious spaces.

This suggests that: average temperature difference across sites is several degrees at most, spatial variability lower at 6 am than at 4pm (PUT NUMBERS HERE), and green spaces more variable than non-green spaces This implies that temperature variability within the urban heat island is lower than suggested by satellite land surface temperature products. Futhermore, as semi-variograms fit to are used in Kreiging spatial estimation technique this suggests that the simple Kreiging model would accurately model temperature data in an urban setting.

\subsection{Landcover}
Green infrastructure is one commonly cited means to combat urban heating (cite EPA toolkit). There are many types of green infrastructure, in Baltimore, parks, fields, and forested areas are common. We find that 
observations in green sites are significantly cooler than impervious sites. This is particularly true at 6 am, when $\overline{T}_{green} = $ and $\overline{T}_{imp} = $.
However, green sites are more variable: $\sigma_{green} = $ whereas $\sigma_{imp} = $. This indicates that using green infrastructure as a heat mitigation strategy may vary in both timing and effectiveness. 

Because there is no common index for assessing green infrastructure, we turn to satellite-measured NDVI, a proxy for photosynthetic activity that can indicate the presence of vegetation. Our observations indicate that variability in NDVI is an important factor in determining spatial variability of 2 meter temperature. 
There is also a relationship between temperature and satellite NDVI measurements, a proxy for surface vegetation. In Fig. X, NDVI is plotted against temperature for a) all times, showing a negative relationship between vegetation and temperature. The relationship is stronger for 6 am temperature (r = -0.68, Fig.~Xb) than in the afternoon (r = -0.21, Fig.~Xc). 

\subsection{Surface Energy Budget}
In order to diagnose what causes the discrepencies between model and observation, we turn to the surface energy budget. In Fig.~\ref{fig:seb}a, we show the diurnal cycle of the net energy flux $F$ averaged over the summertime for each land type. We see that $F$ is highest for  High intensity land, with medium, low and open space having the same net flux. Rural forests show the lowest net flux. Error bars show that for each land type, there is little spatial variability.  

To diagnose why, we turn to the components of the surface energy budget (eq.~\ref{eq:seb}). The sensible heat flux (Fig.~\ref{fig:seb}b) is highest for high intensity land, and lowest for the rural forest. 

In WRF, emissivity is fixed for each land cover class, though the vegetative fraction is not. Emissivity for high intensity land is $0.88$, lower than
